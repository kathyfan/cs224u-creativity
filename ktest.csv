The project cloud include purchasing land or working with an already established resort.

Each restaurant will serve a different type of food as part of an overall meal. Guest will travel by snow mobile to each stop and enjoy their portion of the meal before moving on to the next stop. Guest have the choice to bypass restaurant but pricing will remain the same. In total of 8 stops, for an 8 course meal. The project would call for purchasing or lease snow mobiles and have drivers to take guests to the restaurants or have guest sign release to drive themselves. At the end of the evening guests meet in lodge/hotel to relax and discuss the event Atmosphere for the resultants should be glacial themed, but each interior should have a different vibe.",5.075,0.03450327796711771

It would give a person a way to see what day to day life would be like. This would work well with extended stay type of trips. It would also be helpful to provide different types of immersion.

There are hole in the wall restaurants, mom and pop diners, boutique hotels, walking tours that are off the beaten path and don't make the 'headlines' but are well worth the time and money. This idea wll involve gathering knowledge from the locals and keeping this informatio a bit tight lipped.I'm marketing places (hotels, restaurants, attractions) on the down low and don't want to it known to everyone.

"Everest Clean-up Expedition: Once in a lifetime opportunity to both experience and honor the world's highest mountain. Though reaching the summit of Mt. Everest is unquestionably a great challenge and an amazing accomplishment, the number of successful attempts in recent decades have somewhat diminished its wow factor. Add to this the heartbreaking stories of tons of trash left behind on her slopes by her many ascenders, and the time to redefine adventure travel to Everest has come. Now, those seeking the ultimate outdoor challenge can take away a profound mountaineering experience while giving back to the mountain itself. This travel package begins with a fascinating and history-rich stay in cozy accommodations in a foothill resort, then moves to base camp for intense training and acclimation. Next the slopes -- climb with local guides to areas in need of clean-up. Marvel at the stunning scenery as you beautify the most storied elevations on earth. Then descend back to base camp to a grand party to celebrate.

"The final idea will be a tourist being able to hire a local expert through a sort of catalog system for their own version of a local tour, like having a friend taking you around all sorts of cool spots. It can be similar to UBER how any local citizen can sign up. The tour guides will be listed based on personalities, hobbies/interests and what area they're most familiar with. They can put up a little bio about themselves to give the customer a feel of what they're like. It can be local citizens hired through this catalog, or hand-picked by the actual company. The tour guide can be given a budget of what the tourist is actually willing to spend, and then make an outlined plan of where they can take them and what they can do. If the tour guide is more an athletic type and the customer has a modest budget, they can go surfing with their tour guide and rent a surfboard at a low cost. The tour guide can tell them about the history of the area and just have fun with them. If they like food and wine and have money to burn, they can browse a more urban area that have the finest restaurants, taking them on a fancy food tour. The travel company can partnership with local businesses around the area to offer customers discounts and package deals. It helps give back to local businesses and boosts economy. Say if the customer wants to visit all the local butcher shops, they can arrange something with the butchers beforehand to offer samples or some sort of mini-meal, and deals for the customer to buy a nice selection of some sort of meat. How this whole system compares to the typical tour guide company is that because you're hiring everyday locals, they'd know places that the company beforehand didn't arrange in usually touristy areas, where things are likely less authentic and more cater to tourists. The people you hire will take you to places they go to and know personally. They'd also be able to offer you information that doesn't come from the run-of-the-mill tourist guide speech, but an actual local person telling these things to you from their own experience and words.",4.85,0.019555285163358464

"This would be a tour by train. The customer would rent either a complete rail car or a portion of a shared car. The service would take advantage of unused capacity of commercial rail by connecting cars to the train for leisure travel. The theme of the tour would be ""The Old West"" and would originate in various towns throughout the Midwest and West where customers could ""fly in"" and join the tour. The ultimate destination is unknown to the client. What they're paying for is the experience of riding the rail and immersing themselves in the experience. The trip would be a sort of grand Improvisation. The focus could be around old west towns, and even when the client doesn't know the destination, the staff will be aware of where they are going. The cars are outfitted in the luxurious style from the 1800's. The client can have access to period clothing and would be able to role play in period clothing if desired. The service team would also periodically make announcements into the cabin that would explain landscape features, upcoming towns and their history or some other aspect of their location uniqueness. If there are a group of cars, they can be connected to common cars, available through side hallways in each connecting car. This would allow participants to interact with others, role play and share group meals in a dining car. This could also enable other sorts of evening entertainment, including music or readings done by either the staff or guests. The connections to the train could be dynamic, such that not everyone has the same starting point. In other words, you might ""fly in"" to Santa Fe, or Wichita or some other location to join the train. This would ensure a more diverse experience and repeatable.

"A Crime Aboard the Improv Express, a vacation event inspired by classic mystery movies, dinner theater, and theme park character interactions. Before passengers arrive, the actors/employees of the Improv Express will select a random mystery scenario from a hat. Then, the employees will be assigned roles to play within that scenario. Depending on the scenario, an employee will prepare in advance a ""crime scene."" This could be located in a spare cabin, in the baggage claim, or in another area unlikely to be used by passengers. When the train is ready to leave, passengers will be boarded and shown to their rooms. Through continental meals and a recreational cabin, passengers will be encouraged to acquaint themselves with the staff and comingle with fellow travelers. After a few hours, the conductor will announce over the intercom that there has been a situation. He or she will then ask all passengers and staff members to report to the recreational cabin. Once everyone is there, the train manager will announce that a terrible event has taken place. This could be anything from a murder to a theft to a hijacking. The only consistency is that it happened before the passengers boarded, meaning the criminal is one of the train employees. After announcing the crime, a detective (really an actor, but he or she will board with the passengers to give the illusion that his or her presence was an cooincidence) will stand up, explain the situation, and call out certain train employees. This will let the passengers know who the criminal might be. The detective will ask the passengers to help him or her figure out whodunit. For several hours, passengers will have the ability to talk with the accused employees, ask questions, examine the crime scene, and work with the detective. At some point during this time (peferrably spurred on by a passenger's discovery), the detective will announce that a clue has been found or a discovery has been made. After several more hours of discussion and thought, the detective will call everybody together, explain where the investigation stands, and ask for any final accusations. Then, he will have the passengers vote on who the criminal is. If they're right, the criminal will announce his or her prescence (""foiled again!"") and run away. If they're wrong, the criminal will reveal his or herself, give a maniacal speech, and flee. Finally, the detective will give a classic mystery monologue explaining the complexities of the situation. If a traveler found significant clues during the case, the detective will mention the individual by name and reward him or her with a small prize.

"This vacation or trip would involve 12 participants and each participant is from a different nation. The purpose would be to have to represent the most diversity as possible from the inhabitable continents. On this vacation, the days are free but during the night, there are encounter groups led by facilitators. Either facilitators know the languages of the participants or translation apps are used in real-time. The point of the trip is threefold: (1) To learn, firsthand, about different cultures from around the world (2) You are representing your culture, so you are an ambassador, of sorts. (3) You learn about yourself and your culture by seeing that deep-seated assumptions about your life and world may or may not be true for someone else. Hopefully, you have increased empathy and tolerance from these encounters. The encounter groups would be fun, as this is a vacation after all. It wouldn't be as deep as group therapy and it wouldn't be some cheesy ""com by ya"" type of encounter where fake harmony and superficial glossing over of differences is achieved. Activities would be engaging and enlivening but the ulterior motive would be to achieve new found levels of respect and tolerance for other cultures, peoples and to gain insight into other people's value systems, religions, cultural customs. Language translation would be a significant barrier so real-time translation software would have to reach a level of sophistication to be both accurate and quick. Hopefully facilitators would have some multi lingual experience, but it would be high expectations to assume the facilitators would be good enough to run groups from different cultures and to know a lot of different languages. Perhaps there would website where participants could share their experiences, so it would be a hub for others who can't go on these trips to learn about cultural diversity and tolerances through these types of trips. Maybe one exercise or encounter would be devoted to the question, ""If you could start from scratch and build a new culture with the participants on the trip, what would this look like? What values would you want to keep from your old culture? What values and customs would you abandon and discard?""

"""Fly Your Time"" These days a lot of people have to alter their traveling arrangements for a litany of reasons ranging from personal to professional. These same people often do not want to fly on Southwest. One of the biggest problems with doing that is most airlines charge anywhere from $200-$400 to change flights and it is only based on availability even if you are willing to pay that much. With the world going to mobile on demand movement, why not have an app where you can change your flight for a much smaller fee of $25. Why would the airlines be willing to give this up? One reason would be it would it behoove travelers to fly out of major airline hubs (i.e. ORD/SFO- United, MIA/DFW- American etc.) Another attachment to this program must be that the passenger must join the frequent flyer program of they airline on which they want to change flights. I know airlines do offer flexible airfares now but on United it is basically 200% of the cost of a regular ticket, so those do not really work for most people. So how would the app work? There would basically be main two pages. One where you could list your flight you are on and one where you can search what flights other people have listed. Once someone selects a flight they are interested in, the person who listed it can choose if they want to accept the ""trade"" or not. Only one pending offer can be allowed at a time. This could also get major corporate interest as many corporations have to have their employees change flights all the time in the world's major cities. By being able to save considerably they could be more profitable long term. The only couple things I would have to learn more about are FAA regulations for switching flights and the time cutoff the app would need, but I imagine a 4 hour cut off should be allowed.

I would modernize the approach to train travel by combining my three origional ideas. I would update the infrastructure to a magnetic drive over a monorail that would leave a much smaller footprint on the environment. This would achieve increased efficency and less noise polution since you would not have the sounds of the train rolling over wooden tracks. This is a potential energy savings as well. Since there will be no wheels to ride over I would redesign the cars so that they had more headroom on the inside to give a feel of spaciosness and to encompany this I would make a large percentage of them see through like glass bubble tops. This would increase the touring pleasure and drive business. Finally in these new cars I would increase amentiies such as cafes and offering wireless service to riders. The last element would be to enable e-pay to make it easier for tech savy riders while also lowering overhead by eliminating some of the conductors responsibilities.,4.525,0.0413802944301184

Speaking of roses, there would be a fresh bouquet of them on every table in your suite and fresh food in your fridge to do with as you desire or tell the cook to do with it.

"The Treasure Hunt. The idea is to create an adventure but its fake. Maybe there are multiple scenarios. You are briefed on the story or scenario. Either from a video or actor/actress/employee. Once the package has been purchased and you and your group know what you are doing you will be brought to an ""sandboxed"" area (no this has nothing to do with sand.) where a large amount of land is controlled by the company offering the experience with controlled settings. This area should likely be large enough so that if one knew exactly where everything was hidden it would take approximately 30-60min to complete. The area will contain various landmarks either created by the owning company or natural landmark like a waterfall or mass of rocks. Perhaps you are offered a treasure map and you need to match up landmarks, get a view from a landmark or answer riddles to point you in the right direction where you will find a clue to lead you in the right direction. There should be several areas of interest which are of no relation to our hunt so that people can't simply wander and find the mystery. Rewards for finding the treasure should be something which can be replenished. Possible winnings could include free nights at hotel, paid spa visit or dinner. Reward for failing to secure the treasure should be a memorable keepsake such as an ancient appearing coin made of metal or coin and aged. It would feature the name of the resort, glyphs, etc and should be of minimal value $5-10 and not plastic/throwaway item.",4.55,0.02864165750631024

The travel packet would offer the possibility to join his/her favorite team for one week, training with the athletes a couple hours a day, and then staying in the sport village of the team (or in the same structure in which at least part of the athletes stay). This activity shouldn't be disruptive of the focus of the team, so I see it working as a parallel activity to the normal routine of the team. You would get a chance to be near to your sport heroes, but without interfering in their training (so you could also have a training routine dedicated to your own athletic abilities).

If enough travelers purchase the surprise package, the travel company can arrange which travelers get which packages to optimize costs. Note that the company should actually send members of the pool of customers that purchased the Surprise package to each location to manage reputational (and possibly legal) risk. The company doesn't have to send travelers in equal proportions: the most expensive package gets a few, the moderately priced one gets a few more, and the cheapest package gets the most. The travel company can make these vacations look almost comparable, but there is still some ranking of price. The weighted average of the prices of these packages can be the price of the Surprise package. The idea is to appeal to budget-conscious travelers.

"The company advertising the travel package ideally should have a rough estimate of where the customer is located and the trips they have already gone to. This is necessary to prevent the person from visiting a location they already have thoroughly experienced, and would negatively affect their outlook and perceptions towards the trip. This is done through a survey offered by the company, which in addition also gathers potential interests to better gauge and decide which destination would be the best choice for the customer to travel to. Ideally, the survey should be fun and streamlined, offered online, and quite similar to the surveys most individuals are familiar with and proficient in. After the customer submits the survey (or multiple questionnaires), they are given directions to a pick up location, a train station where the train will arrive at a given time. This train station ideally can be a bigger train station, with multiple destinations and stops, to better give an impression of mystery and improvisation. However, a smaller train station could be implemented if the customer destination is more secluded.

The train ride could take hours, depending on the travel from initial location to the destination. Once the individual arrives at the destination, they are given the necessary identification and receipts for their stay at a hotel, airbnb, or other lodging/housing. Whatever lodging the individual stays at depends on the price of the travel package the individual paid for, and should be in line or complementary for the destination location.

For starters, the train tracks should be painted and there should be a hollow tunnel built around the train tracks which would be a ""galaxy tunnel"" to keep travelers from getting irritable and bored and make them feel more relaxed on their trip. The train tracks should also be rerouted so that they can stop at stores, movie theaters, and shopping malls mid trip so that travelers get a break from being inside cramped train cars and can walk around and stretch their feet. They can get an hour break from being on the train. Additionally, travelers need a change in scenery that does not involve looking at trees and rocks on the way to their destination. And train rides can take long, exhausting hours. They should dig underground tunnels to reroute train tracks so that trips are faster and take up less travel time overall. Train tracks coming out of ground should enter beaches and landmarks so that travelers are kept content and happy.

Given the comfort of the host family and/or travelers, lodging experiences can differ, whether the travelers stay with the host family, stay with the host family in a separate unit, the host family stays at a hotel with the travelers, or they just meet up every day at a specified place and go back to separate lodging places at the end of the day To combat any boredom an experience like this could potentially create, the traveling company would build into the vacation, a few different adventurous activities, or leisure activities, and restaurant and/or nightlife experiences that the host family is compensated for and agrees upon. This experience would give a traveler a unique experience and bring about some uncertainty and excitement into the vacation, as there is not an itinerary that dictates their vacation experience. Something like this could potentially lead to some difficulties and potential danger. Some steps would be in place for the family or travelers to cancel the rest of the vacation at any point. If this is the case, the traveling company can have steps in place to allow the travelers to choose a pre-determined set of vacation spots and activities and lodging to round out the rest of their vacation experience. This sort of vacation experience would allow the traveler to fully experience the culture and country in which they are curious to learn about and vacation to.",4.725,0.014584947642137372

The travel agency could partner with 23&me or Ancestry.com to make European travel packages for people to travel through Europe by train to see where they came from. The partnership would allow the travel agency to send targeted emails and/or brochures to people who come from specific places. The travel plans would be open to improvisation because people could decide to visit one city or place longer than others. The travel agency would have set up accommodations that are flexible to work with people. Travelers would arrive in a European city and meet the train. Once on the train, the travel agency could have historians on board to give talks about the histories of the places they will be seeing because these types of travelers will be interested in that. There could also be genealogists on board to help people trace their roots in more depth and attempt to locate locals that are related to the travelers. The travel agency could arrange for meetings with relatives if both groups are interested. If the train doesn't travel to the specific city, the travel agency would arrange transportation and lodgings.

"My idea is a train ride between 2 cities in the west that would put on shows for the passengers, either a murder mystery dinner style, or a fun, non-violent version of a famous train heist. The cities would be out west, and everything from the train's physical appearance to the crew's outfits would historically match the time. The ride would ideally be about 2.5 hours, which would be enough for the 1 hour show and a dinner afterwards before reaching their destination. For the train heist, passengers would know when buying tickets that participation would be expected, but they would not know the details. Upon entering the car they would be given a slip stating whether they are innocent passengers (AKA bystanders, and they would have to listen to whomever gives them further instructions), police officers in hiding who were tipped off about the potential heist, or the ""gang members"" who are also in hiding on the train. The train's official crew would be the leaders of the heist, and would ideally be reenacting a famous train heist like Butch Cassidy's. Throughout the show the passengers would have to decide things like how they are going to break into ""locked"" cars, how they will try to discover the police officers, and how to negotiate with police officers once they have innocent bystanders held hostage. In this sense, it would also be part escape room as well, because the innocent bystanders would also have a chance to escape and alert more police officers to the problem. At the end, there would be a brief educational presentation to demonstrate how the actual heist played out, provide some local history of the area the people were going to, and then distribute dinner to everyone before they leave.",5.0,0.02124296443310437
"A travel agency that arranges train tours in random/surprise destinations. A traveler can describe the time they would like to be on this vacation and their budget. Then, the company picks a location somewhere in the world that has a passenger rail system. Then the traveler is told where they will be going right before their scheduled departure. It could be customizable. For example, a traveler may select the continent, country, or region they'd like to visit. The traveler could select specific cities or locations to be included on their train vacation. Or, in contrast, the traveler could choose to leave all the details up to the travel agency. Any place that has a passenger rail system is fair game. A traveler could go on a short jaunt across a section of the United States or Canada. Or they could spend a week or two traveling across Japan, Europe, Russia, etc. I imagine this type of travel mimicking the cruise industry where traveling is half the fun, and the traveler would stop every day or two at a new city or location and have ""land"" excursions for the day. It would also mimic the cruise industry in that it could be all-inclusive (food and alcohol). I think the randomness adds adventure and the train provides an amazing look at the countryside for the traveler.

Essentially a huge underwater aquarium that lets people get very close to the action and take an imaginative journey on the ""ocean floor"".

I would say that the people who want this service should sign up with their cell phone company and pay for the service like a small $5 charge a month.

"When traveling throughout the world, getting from one location to another is done by train, bus, or plane. To travel by plane or train, separate tickets have to be purchased outside of public transportation passes. Public transportation passes allow travel using any bus, trolleybus, or metro only. The pass can be used anytime and anywhere. Traveling by plane or train is completely different as a ticket must be purchased for a one-way trip or round-trip only. Each time a person is wanting to travel by train or plane, they must purchase a ticket. To simplify the process, travel companies should establish an all-inclusive pass for use among any railroad or public transportation system. This would mean that a traveler would not have to find somewhere to purchase individual tickets or a public transportation pass. The individual would be able to receive a single pass upon arriving at their hotel and that pass would be valid for the entire trip for any transportation system excluding airline travel. This means they could travel anywhere in the country for a flat-rate fee without worry of purchasing separate tickets or passes.

"The most important aspect of traveling is options. A traveling train that takes you to every major city and town in every state of the country. It would stop at every single tourist destination or you could custom plan your stops or just wing it completely, depends on what you are looking for. The inside of the train could be like a hotel or like a tour bus depending on what part you are in. It would offer everything a person could need when traveling. There would be someone explaining anything and everything worth seeing while your passing by it on the train. You have option to get off at any stop and explore further if you wish for limited amount of time. If you want to stay longer than you can also stay and hop on another train to continue your experience. There would be no official plan, so everything would be a surprise, fun and different. Every experience would be unique. Places the train can't take you, the train would get you as close as possible.",3.8,0.03785055820522323
"Let me lay out how every vacation has gone for you in the last few years. You spend months before the trip researching the most beautiful places to go, weeks looking up hotel arrangements and activities to do. How about budgeting for food and making compromises for easy breakfast, for example choosing a more expensive hotel to get complimentary breakfast. Is that about right? You choose to do the things you like, and never branch out to something you are uncomfortable doing. This travel experience is to break down the barriers of confidence and experience a vacation as it should be done, going beyond your culture and life, into a world of change and new activities. This trip is geared towards those who aren't afraid to new challenged, and aren't afraid to try something new. Here is how it works: You book a travel experience with us. We give you three pieces of information: The country, the length of time the trip is, and how expensive it is. You know very little outside of that information. It is a guided travel experience where a group of travelers go together to a new land all under the same knowledge level you are at right now. During the trip, the travelers will be taken to a new place everyday using a train as transportation. The reason for this is to soak in as much of the landscape and nature as we can during the length of time we are here. Each day, you will be given the day's agenda in the morning that will list times for each activity and what it is. Most of these activities will be very new to the travelers and will test our ability to break outside of our comfort zone. Each meal will be a list of a few things that will treat you to a new cuisine. In addition to this, the lodging will be new and interesting, often dabbling into local customs and traditions. The trip will break you into a new 'yes' mentality and help you to overcome things that often hold back your inhibitions and desires. The trip is more than just a vacation, it is a travel experience and a life changing motivator. Once you return home, you will have a new outlook on travel, life and what you are capable of. You will learn of a culture from the inside out and your appreciation for your own daily life will be enhanced. If this is something you are ready for, please book a once in a lifetime experience with us.",4.75,0.016277925334825298
"My idea (if it doesn't already exist) would be a hotel airplane that cruises across the world from spot to the next. Each person on the airplane would have a fully stocked room, a resturaunt on the plane, a bar, and various forms of entertainment. They'd fly from one major travel spot to another, taking into account weather and major events around the world. Each stop would give the passengers numerous days to explore the city and enjoy themselves, all travel and hotel expenses covered as apart of the package. They'd then meet back up at the plane and travel to the next spot. Each passenger would experience a wide variety of cultures and travel locations as part of the package. It'd eventually lead right back where they started",5.075,0.047036043419179864

"The Dangerous Roads series had a team travel to the Arctic who experienced the high excitement and anxiety of traveling on that highway. People would be flown on a plane, like Allegiant, that can cater to a group traveling to the spot where they would travel via a tour bus to the Arctic. On the plane, they would be warmly greeted upon entering the plane. There would be videos of what they will experience in Alaska and the Arctic. They would eat food that is traditional to the Alaskan (Inuit) world. They would hear music and taste drinks associated with Alaska. It would be fun! The plane would be filled with hosts who would wait on the guests with love. These people would be people who are not only bright humans but people who love working with humans -- extroverts. Maybe some tall tales would be told! Upon landing, there would be a debriefing on what's ahead as the tour bus takes them to their lodging for the night. A themed-dinner would be served. A chance to swim or exercise would be available before the long journey ahead. Lots of good rest would be available in order to prepare for the trip ahead. And then the trip begins. The trip itself is exciting. The bus would stop at certain points to allow for photography and to talk to locals and to eat. When the Arctic is reached, climate scientists would carefully and clearly explain what is happening in the Arctic and how they know it to be fact. What is needed to adapt to the new climate? What are scientists still learning? What is the impact on wildlife, on Inuits, on the weather in Canada/US and the impact on the oceans? Lots of time to ask questions and learn first-hand will be offered. The trip back will be by helicopter! They will be able to see the expanse of the world there. They will arrive at a hotel and be given a great meal by locals. They will have an opportunity to interact with local people and learn their fears and dreams and customs and ways of living. They will return home, having had both an exciting time and an amazing learning experience. ​",4.9,0.017471413945365305
"The idea is a murder mystery game train ride. The train will be decorated to look like those old-fashioned trains from before. The operation of the train will be run by train employees and there will be kitchen staff and servers, but the game itself will be ran by a hired cast who will be managing the game and making everything runs accordingly. A writer will be used to write different mysteries and scenarios within those mysteries so that it can be completely unexpected to the riders. After we get more popular, we will use guest mystery writers to write some of the mysteries. The trip will consist of one trip where you start and end up in the same place. It will take from 4 to 6 hours. A meal and drinks will be served during the game. It will be advertised in many different cities and lots of places online where people who like mysteries would normally go. The first few trips, social media influencers will receive free invitations so that can talk about it and spread the word. When people buy tickets, they get assigned a character, background on character, and tips on what to wear. People will board already knowing who their character is and the game will begin as soon as they are boarding. The person who will be killed will be killed within the first hour. People would be able to go from one part of the train to another to figure out clues and talk to the other people . The people will not know who is another paid traveler or who is a paid character. The goal of the game is to find out who to trust and work together to figure out who the killer is.",5.1,0.021989974856677124
"My idea is to give a unique extensive experience to those who wish to understand how the earlier ages felt like. It's about preparing a historical place like a temple or a palace in a way that allows the visitor to experience the atmosphere of this place and time. I suggest training actors professionally so they can be a part of the place and the time of where this place was built. After a professional welcome from those actors they would introduce the visitors to the place in a way that makes them feel like they are a part of a historical event that happened in this place a long time ago, then eating and drinking the same way like those people ate and drank at this time etc.",4.075,0.04657464328326223
I propose a vehicle that operates on train tracks and would have several alternators on each wheel. The vehicle would have an electric engine that would be powered by a power cell to get the vehicle moving. The top of the cars would contain several solar panels to gain more power for the engine and heater and air conditioning units that would be needed for passenger comfort. The engine would receive power from the solar panels and the alternators to maintain enough power to operate the engine. The vehicle would need to be designed much like a train to hold many passengers.,4.55,0.051917413165116506

With pre-planned activities and the local showing off their country.The ""locals"" would get a moderate fee for their troubles. Have a rating system ranking each ""local"". We could call it The Local Locator. A lot of logistics would be necessary but it could be feasible. With the internet it would be fairly easy to get applicants from other countries.

"My final idea is to incorporate Escape the room style challenges into a multi-day vacation. Vacationers would pick from several multi day packages that are individual to the size of the group vacationing together. So there could be packages for 3, 5, 7, days etc for groups as small as 2 to maybe up to 8 or 10. The scenarios would be specific to those characteristics. So the idea would be completing a multi day escape the room, puzzle mystery that gets solved at the end of the trip. It would not be the whole vacation and there would be ample time for these groups to experience whatever else they were on vacation to do. But there would be certain times when they would be involved in the game. These games can range anywhere from murder mystery types, to ancient artifact, to apocalypse style gaming. Patrons can choose to have their games set at a time, or to be more realistic, times can be varied and random, meaning players have to stay on their toes and be ready to go. The rooms themselves could be all themed as well, including various hidden closets, rooms, etc that the players/vacationers can explore and find during their trip. Also, area restaurants or locations could also be used that allow the people to explore the neighboring area as well as continuing with the game. It would help to benefit the local area and make the whole game more interesting since you are not locked into just the resort area. People love Escape the rooms. People love puzzles and figuring things out. Every time I have done an Escape the Room, I always say I just wish it was longer. This way it could be longer.",5.2,0.023755716907278998

"I think it would be a fun experience for travelers to have a ""surprise"" destination vacation via train! First, vacationers will decide on the length of a train trip they'd be willing to take and their desired climate of their final destination. Based on their answers travelers can then select up to three different destinations from multiple places in the US that are offered as destinations for this travel experience (but not know which of the three will be chosen) or better yet they can allow this to be a complete surprise. Once they reach the surprise destination travelers will have the choice to extend their vacation time to stay and tour their surprise destination or they will be provided a flight back to their home. If they choose to stay they can choose a hotel package based on the amount of money they want to spend.

"So suppose that your group of tourists have purchased their travel experience train tickets, except there is a catch. This is a murder mystery train experience (think similar marketing to escape rooms etc). Once the journey begins, everyone is shown a short briefing instructional video. This video lays out the rules for how to play the game, objectives, etc (this is the kind of thing they do nowadays before starting a laser-tag game in some places). Once everyone has been briefed, a murderer is chosen at random secretly. Only this individual knows that he is the murderer. The game then consists of five 15 minute rounds (this can change depending on how long the train ride is) where each round consists of interrogations and other challenges. The goal is to ensure that everyone is having fun and investing themselves in the game. At this end of each round the murderer gets to anonymously choose his/her next victim. This person is then eliminated from the game (murdered). Once the next round starts, a majority vote is held for who the murderer is (whoever wins this vote is then murdered). This operates under very similar rules to the game 'Mafia'. It's very unlikely (depending on how many passengers there are) that this game ends prematurely. Everyone is bound to have a good time and this is a train ride like no other!",4.5,0.02797271194322297
"Did you ever wish you could enjoy the luxury of cross-country travel without flying? Do you prefer to see sights along the way and take everything in as opposed to simply arriving in a few hours? This could be a new and fun way to explore the country. You would be able to choose a package based on the specific destination stops that you would want to explore along the way, from only 2 or 3 to many more, depending on how much time you wish to spend on your amazing trip. This holiday would combine travel and accommodations in your own rented train car, complete with bed, restroom/shower, and a mini fridge, much like a hotel room. The train car would also have a rooftop getaway for enjoying the night sky when you are at a 1 or 2 day stop. These train cars would be much more luxurious than the typical sleeper car you may be familiar with and the entrance to your own private car would also not be a typical style train entrance, and it would of course be handicap accessible. The Arch in St. Louis, Mount Rushmore, Yellowstone National Park, Nashville, or Niagara Falls are just a few of the potential spots to exit the train and take in the sights. A personal transport service to and from the train would be provided for outings.

Firstly there would be the people who are already traveling as part of there trips. Be it using trains to go visiting different cities or automobiles. This would be a way to get from, say Seattle to San Francisco, while also having a uniques experience. The other type of traveller it could appeal to is person who is just looking for a unique experience even though visiting different cities is not part of their agenda. I think the idea of incorporating escape rooms and tailoring them to the train theme would offer a unique experience to travellers.

"The travel would be by train and would basically cater to the retiring class. Travel would be in a leisurely fashion and the itinerary is determined by the guest as they travel. Many topics are explored on the train during the travel. Local lecturers are provided that educate the travelers on the local lore and features of the area. One can learn history that is not readily available on line or in books. With the population growing older and retiring there is an itch to see the country. These people have much free time and are looking for activities to keep them entertained. Being a leisurely type of travel would allow them to enjoy their freedom and get the most out of traveling without having to live in an RV and set it up where ever they go. They just need transportation and a place to sleep. There would be an atmosphere of meeting new folks that share their interest. ​With the ability to always catch a train, the time they take to explore an area can be open-ended. There are guest speakers that will join the train of people intimately connected with the locations you are going to visit. You will learn history that is not readily available on line or in books. Guest speakers could be very unique such as scientists that explain the windmill or solar technology as you explore places in the country that are using new types of renewable energy. Local writers or talent could speak or even perform. In Amish country you could converse with members of the community and find out what it's like to be in that society. If you are interested in exploring caves, there could be speakers that are intimately knowledgeable of the local caves and local lore. If haunted houses are your thing, you could follow a map of haunted houses and attend lectures by people who know the stories. Folk lore is very powerful and all areas of the country have it. You could have different speakers on different train cars. The train is a fluid style leaving you in an area to explore at your leisure. You can catch the next one coming through. If you're in a lake area, you could rent cabins on the lake for a couple of days of enjoying the water. The speakers could even run the gamut on the same area.

There could be different labs that do space related things. Like Jurassic park (the original, obviously) but for ""space fossils"". Here you would learn about meteorite/asteroid/meteoroids, and the equipment used to find them. A bit like a terrestrial, learning ISS. It needs to be built on sparse rocky land with little or no vegetation. In the mornings everyone will gather for a briefing on the day, and be assigned a guide. They will take small groups out to various areas in up-scaled Lunar Roving Vehicles (Jeeps or some such made to look similar). Lunch would be provided while still 'in the field'.

Real food, not TV space food nonsense. ​ It could be land or sea-based, or both. A scuba diving/meteorite hunt would be amazing. During the learning period you could also get your scuba certification.

The first step is to find a place where there is a stretch of old historic train stations and plan for about three days of visits while riding the train to each. There is such a place here in Ohio. The location should be in a place during summer or spring. The planning begins with locating the stretch and then how to reserve them for the writing classes Each place should be in a place that is beautiful and historical. The second step would be to find writing instructors. Next, research the history of each station. Next, research hotels near the train stations. Also, organize some side trips in the area for free time. I would then work with the instructors to create a curriculum. The instructors would also think of ideas for creating short stories about trains. We could also incorporate some short film trips about trains to stimulate creative ideas.

This could be done by elevating the wheels (contact point) so they are not in contact with the tracks. There is currently mag lev technology available and may be other ideas that could work equally well or better. This immediately takes a lot of the vibration from the ground and transfers it to the train itself. Other ideas: Balance the load so the weight is distributed evenly, causing less strain and equalizing the stress points.

"A luxury train trip through the Western United States where YOU get to pick the stops. The passengers make the itinerary. Once on the train, passengers are given a list of possible destinations that the train can stop. The passengers will have the chance to vote on the stops they want to make. To help in making their decisions, train cars will be set up highlighting different stops and why a passenger might want to stop in that location. If someone votes for a particular stop but there are not enough votes to make the stop, they have the opportunity to present to the other passengers reasons why they should stop, and the other passengers have the chance to change their vote. The food on bored the train will be chosen dependent on what stops the train will make, It will highlight the cuisine of the particular area that the train will stop. If a passenger or group of passengers decide that they want to spend more time at a particular stop, they have the opportunity to stay longer and a car or bus will transport them to the next destination, to meet back up with the train,",4.05,0.027555424922739644
"My idea is to create a fun cruise/travel experience for families with children with disabilities. As a mother with a son with autism, there is hardly anything we can do that I feel comfortable with. I want a travel experience that can benefit the child and the family. Have areas where the child can have sensory input and learn, but also these areas will be fun with the parents too. The most important thing to me is to have professionals that can watch these children while the parents have some alone time. Having a child with a disability makes it hard to have alone time with your spouse. This travel experience can give families that with comfort knowing their child is being watched. Whether this is a cruise experience, beach get away, or amusement area it will be affordable and accommodating for the families.",5.05,0.04351941398892446
"People enter a train car where they are greeted with table of historical daily life items. They put aside all of their modern items such as phones, spare change, hats, but not clothes or valuables, and exchange them for their historic equivalents. They would get to interact with these things, such as pocket watches, gold coins, cool vintage hats as they rode the train. It would help them interact with old items and get a hands on feel for history, without being overwhelming by having to change clothes or valuable items. They would just get to use some of these items, say to pay for things on the train, to tell the time, etc. The food items could also be based on old historic times also. Besides food items, their would be a wide array of everyday historical items, like old newspapers, vintage cameras, binoculars, and other useful items to pick up and use. The train staff could then reenact the job done by their historic counterparts. They could also share history lessons along the way. In addition they could show other historic items of the time as they gave lessons.​",4.95,0.03258176062255373
"I will find investors and partners that want to own shares of the company that will be developed as part of this hotel and travel idea. I will invest a lot of time into researching locations worldwide where I can develop this idea that will help it be ideal but I will also meet with environmentalists to gather their opinion ​because I don't want this project to negatively impact the environment. After finding the location I will find a team of financial advisors to determine the costs and benefits, once the numbers are crunched I will finally meet with architects and engineers to get building plans. I want this idea to be grand so I want to have expert opinions. The final idea is to have a train or some sort of carriage transported along train tracks powered by the eco-friendly exercise activities of the guests. The train tracks will pass through wildlife areas that are protected and unharmed by the train tracks. It will be an experience for the guests to experience nature with an environmentally friendly touch without losing that experience of luxury as well.",3.775,0.036563621206356534

"America has a lot of old railroad routes that aren't used any longer, so this vacation idea is to develop railroad pods for people to enjoy a combination of the history of America, while also embracing the modern technology that is possible in this world. People will basically just rent a pod car for an amount of time, and then they can have a lot of independence and freedom. A lot of old depots, warehouses, restaurant, and inns are scattered along these old rail tracks, and vacationers can decide what points of interest they wish to visit. Whenever people want to stop, small offshoots or connections would be built into the track, so people can pull in and stop safely. Tesla should and could provide the technology for these personal railway pods. The pods should be just big enough for a driving and a sleeping compartment. The pods will have a lock or digital security on them, so people can sleep with peace of mind. The pods will be mostly transparent, with a glass or plastic dome, for a 360 degree view of surroundings. A map of all the railroad stops could be supplied. These could point out a lot of history, but also give people an idea of distance and navigation. Pods should be solar powered or self-charging, so people don't have to worry about stopping to plug in or fill up somewhere. Some small saloons or cafes could be encouraged to build new shops on the route. This would be good for businesses that want to cash in on this new concept, but it will also provide more points of interest and possibilities for vacationers along the way. Most of the old or unused railroad in the United States should be opened up to this idea, so that people can choose a lot of different regions to visit. Pods should be fast enough to get around, but slow enough for safety. Some pod routes will go by national parks or through the woods, so these hiking and camping choices can be available if people want them. The pods should have USB and wireless internet in them, so that the passengers can be connected, entertained, and make route plans while they are not driving the pod.​",5.525,0.01938188330505549

"The travel idea is to attempt to get people interested in the rich history of PA coal country by creating an adventure-themed vacation package that combines exploring the plight of the Molly Macquires (Irish coal miners of the late 1800s) against the railroad exec Frank Gowen of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and connect it to the public's celebration of St. Patrick's Day. You can combine adventure travel such as white water rafting, mountain biking, or hiking the Pocono mountains with a rich reenactment that can help people sympathize with coal country and infuse much-needed funds into very depressed, poor areas of PA. Using a mystery or drama theater to help people relate to the Molly Maguires that were executed in order for Gowen to crush any ability to unionize might help people connect with the inhabitants of the area and bring in tourism jobs. Pockets of the Poconos are upscale and a vacation spot for New Yorkers who want to get out of the city, but they tend to be isolated. If there were an easier way to connect the shopping areas, hotels & casinos like Mt Airy or Camelback water parks or some of the ski resorts with the rich history of the coal miners, perhaps this area of PA could be more connected to the urban areas that have more jobs. So much of Carbon County is filled with abandoned train tracks and coal mines and yet, there is so much here that could be revitalized if people came up here for more tourism and the towns had better transportation options. These areas offer countless opportunities to get back to nature with white water rafting, hiking, biking, skiing, hunting, and fishing - for people coming down from NY or for people looking to get away from the Philadelphia metro area.",5.05,0.024945491291633416
"A ticket that allowed free travel on rail networks for a certain period of time (e.g. 1 day or 1 week) as opposed to a defined journey would allow for substantially freer mobility and allow for greater improvisation. It would allow for a greater exploration of America, and would be more environmentally friendly than aircraft travel. A greater degree of freedom would allow people to, for example, travel to a number of locations on vacation and choose to spend as much time as they like at each location, deciding how long to stay only once they have arrived.",4.075,0.060858061945018464

"All Aboard the Cannabis Express: Train Tours Through the Heart of Weed Country The legalization of cannabis is one of the more significant developments in U.S. commerce. Legalizing weed has opened up markets across the country, but perhaps nowhere more so at this time than the west coast of America. My plan is to take advantage of this growth industry with a fun, experiential and educational tour through the western U.S. The Cannabis Express will be a train tour that takes passengers from Denver, Colorado to Seattle, Washington. The train lines will need to identified to determine the best route to ensure maximal proximity movers and shakers in the cannabis movement. Trips would be coordinated by a docent or guide on the train, and by local guides at the various points where the tour stops. The train travel would have to be coordinated with the cooperation of Amtrak; alternatively, other more local train companies and tracks could be used for the purpose. This would be a larger-scale version of the Napa Valley Wine Train, offering a fun and educational way for tourists to take in their favorite substance. Best of all, the substance that is the focus of this train journey is now perfectly legal, and the industries that have grown up around it are exciting and new. Tourists would receive an education on the growth, distribution, marketing and sale of cannabis products. Local stops along the way might include a growing facility, a cannabis processing plant, a warehouse where edibles and other products are made, and dispensaries. The tour would be perfect for potheads of all ages, of course, but also be valuable for anyone considering entering into the cannabis industry. It's true that cannabis tourism is already being developed; however, my plan to string together a week- to 10-day train excursion, organized by tours of cannabis grow sites, distribution facilities, dispensaries, and more, is novel and could be a natural success in the current U.S. travel industry. Disclaimer: I am not a consumer of marijuana products. ​",4.9,0.019729584892914265
