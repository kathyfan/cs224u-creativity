"Passive Weighted Toning Child Attachments.  Light weights that attach to a eachother through a child's clothing.  The weight is distributed through the clothing and to the other weight so that the extra weight is not directly attached to or felt by the child.  The weights are soft and sangbaggish in style so as not to have the potential for any injury to the child.  The weights are just heavy enough to prevent toddler aged children and younger from moving very quickly which alleviates parental concerns over accidents from children getting into mischief or falling down stairs,etc.  The weights are only truely felt by the parents when they pick up and carry around their children.  The point is to add a little bit of passive additional weight to the already slightly taxing task of carrying the child around and picking them up multiple times throughout the day.  The little bit of extra weight helps to tone the arm, leg, and back muscles of the parents.  The extra weight is also noticeable enough by the parents upon initial picking up of the child that it reinforces immediate thought into the picking up action - which gives the parent the time to adjust how they will pick up the child, and by doing so boosting proper picking up techniques.

An item from these classes will be randomly selected, potentially along with additional descriptors (e.g. ""blue"" car, ""left-hand turn"" lane). The particular item will rotate every 5-10 minutes.   The operator will be informed which item has been chosen, and will be required to press a button in the car each time this item is observed. If the car detects a particular item but the button is not pressed, a warning message will sound. If the button press is missed multiple times, the car will safely pull over and can only be restarted in non-self-driving mode for a certain period of time.   The concept can be further gamified by allowing operators to register as individual users in the car, which keeps score of how well they do. Users can also ""level up"" with good performance, which gives them somewhat more complicated tasks, e.g. looking for more than one type of object at a time.   Each class of items should be tested in simulation to ensure that it increases focus of the operator on the road as a whole, and does not result in hyper-focus that could cause them to miss important obstacles. E.g. looking specifically for the letter Z on license plates or a pedestrian wearing sunglasses might distract from the road, whereas looking for stop signs will likely not.

"A potential method for making sure drivers in self-driving cars are still paying attention is to have the driver be required to take over for some amount time at a given interval. This interval can be determined by the length of the voyage,  the route or the amount of traffic. At the beginning of the trip the driver will be told he or she will have to take over for certain amount of time during the drive. The indication that the driver will have to take over soon could be signal by a sound, or by vibrations in the seat or steering wheel. There could also be technology to make sure the drive keeps their hands on the wheel at all times. The driver would be able to see a timer that shows a countdown of when they will have to drive.

"In order to keep passengers of self-driving cars fully alert and awake during their ride, it is important that not only are their eyes open but that they are cognitively functioning during their ride. As such, I propose a phone app that becomes activated once the ride is to begin and tracks the ride until the destination. In this duration, the passenger is presented with  a variety of challenges to keep them awake and alert. To incentivize them, the better they do, the more points they earn. Points earned go towards a reward. The rewards will include gift cards to stores like Amazon, Target, Nike, etc. as well as to restaurants. Challenges will include things like the Reaction Task - at one point along the ride, which will be tracked by the app, there will randomly be a reaction task. The passenger will have to press a button on their phone every time they hear a beep. Their eyes will still be able to be on the road since this is an audio task. Another possible task will be naming parks that have been passed. Likewise, naming streets that start with certain letter that have been passed (these are tracked and double checked by app) can be a task of choice. In short, the better the passenger performs on these tasks, the more points they earn. By incentivizing them to do well, we are in turn ensuring that they have motivation to be awake and alert.

These questions could be on the conditions of the road, speed of the car, speed limit of the street, gas tank, side mirrors, etc. To answer the question, the driver must press a red flashing button on the dash to record their answer. If their answer is correct, the driver will be rewarded with positive smells (i.e flowers, coffee, chocolate, their favorite perfume/cologne). If the driver's answer is incorrect, negative smells (i.e manure, smoke, rotten eggs) will be secreted from the car until the driver answers a subsequent question correctly.

"In order to encourage people in driver-less cars to pay attention to the road and be available in case they need to take over, I suggest developing/implementing an eye tracking software that is linked with instant incentivizing for good behavior (eyes tracking according to paying attention to the road) and penalizing for bad behavior (eyes not tracking like driver is paying attention - closing, darting sideways or down).   The tracking software can be mounted near the windshield or perhaps built into the windshield somehow. When the software detects that the driver is paying attention to the road and, thus, could take over in the event of an emergency/need, the driver is rewarded instantly with money, gift cards, or other incentives. They are alerted by sound when they earn these rewards. When the software detects that the driver is drifting off to sleep (eyes closing) or not paying attention (eyes drifting up/down/sideways for a significant period of time), the driver is penalized monetarily (money or incentive revoked) - a sound plays and their seat vibrates to alert them. The incentives and punishments must be significant enough to motivate behavior.   I believe there is potential for this to become highly-personalized and therefor more effective. The software can learn a driver's affinities/habits/likes and use that to reward/punish accordingly. For example, the system can reward a driver with concert tickets to their favorite band/group after the driver performs well with the eye tracking system (aka pays attention) for a significant period of time (one month with no penalties, for example). This will reinforce good behavior and demotivate the bad behavior.",4.416666666666667,0.025457575296697798

"This revolutionary tool to enhance driver concentration is a game that incorporates the real world environment around the car into a virtual and entertaining experience. Driving in an automated vehicle will be safer and more entertaining than ever.  Hardware: a VR headset OR a Heads-Up Display in the windshield. Sensors and cameras around the car.  How the game would work: This is an immersive augmented-reality experience based fully on the car and it's real-time movements and surroundings. The driver can have the same windshield view, but the game adds augmented reality components to the street which composes the entertaining parts of the game. These can be puzzles, controlling characters jumping over cars, creating art around the car's environment, building objects, etc. Very fun games and applications can be developed by third parties. These games are not distracting! They can appeal to all ages (passengers can also use it) and they incorporate the car's real environment: a game can be incorporated into the front and side windshield views. Also, a game can use 360-degree sensors and cameras around the car to simulate a third-person view. The driver now sees the car from the outside. The driver also sees the real surroundings of the car. The car on the right has just turned pink! And there is an elephant on top! Is that a puzzle in the sky? Let me use the voice-activated feature on my headset/windshield to move that elephant to the car in front. Whoops, I forgot the name of the newest augmented reality game. I heard everybody is downloading it on their cars. It just went viral.  Safety component: If the windshield display malfunctions, the windshield becomes a regular windshield automatically without any risk of losing visibility. If the VR headset malfunctions or runs out of battery while the game is playing, assuming the car is still being autonomously driven, the driver can take off the headset and look through the regular windshield. If the car detects an emergency and needs full driver control, the game interface automatically disappears and the driver is able to see everything from the driver's seat without needing to take off the headset. A camera in front of the headset activates to give the driver the complete view of the inside of the car. This process would happen in less than a second. It would be much quicker in an emergency than the process of taking off the headset. A headset like this one is risk-free. If the driver is using the windshield display, it would shut off in an emergency and leave the driver with a regular windshield view. The Heads-Up Display and the VR headset are connected to the automated vehicle's emergency command system.  Branding: an automated car incorporating this augmented reality technology would be recognized publicly as ""Brand-Name Ready."" Car companies will be desperate to incorporate this technology. It will make the driver engaged with the road again. ",4.861111111111111,0.012532351726590002

Every time a self-driving car passes through a check point, ""driver"" has to pull the cord and hold up the name badge so it scans. These check points look like the scanning points for electronic toll tags. If the check point does not scan the barcode (could be for various reasons - you're not paying attention, you didn't pull it out fast enough, glitch of some sort, disability prevents you from pulling the tag out), then your car prompts you to enter a numerical value that pops up on the dash (e.g. 5492). If you can enter that numerical value, then car registers that you are still paying attention. If you can't, then the car pulls over to the side and stops.

"One way for a self-driving car to remind the operator to pay attention is with incessant verbal reminders. However, this can get annoying very quickly, and the operator might mentally tune out.

The pause is noticed, and brings the listener back to the present, but is not annoying.   The operator of the self-driving car will select an audio track of their choice; a podcast, an audiobook, music, etc. Before it begins to play, the car will give instructions that every time the audio pauses, the operator should take a moment to ensure they are still paying attention to their surroundings.

"I would make self-driving cars obey traffic laws and speed limits religiously (or consistently drive at less than the speed limit), but let the driver perform a manual override if and only if he/she is able to actively control a virtualized (meaning, not connected to the actual locomotion) steering wheel, acceleration, and braking system.In other words, I'd let people make their self-driving cars break speed limits if they were willing to pay careful attention to the road, and simulate (or, partially actively control) the driving experience. ""Rewarding"" drivers for paying attention (specifically, for attaining sufficient matching between their steering, gas, and braking behavior with the car's desired behavior) by letting them exceed speed limits (as they would do in a standard vehicle) might do two things: first, it would encourage adoption (people might feel trapped by a car that can't drive faster than the speed limit, and thus avoid purchasing one); and, second, it would encourage people to pay careful attention while driving.   I can see the following disadvantages:  1) If people can drive faster, will they actually be controlling the car? Or, will they be mimicking the behaviors in which they would need to engage in order to control the car in an emergency?  2) There are substantial negative PR and legal consequences to encouraging people to break the law, even if, on balance, it helps keep them safer while driving.  3) No studies have been done to prove that a slow self-driving car with an inattentive backup driver is less safe than a fast self-driving car with an attentive backup driver.  4) People might be afraid to drive near such ""cyborg"" (partially human-controlled, partially machine-controlled) cars.

"The exterior of self-driving cars are already equipped with LIDAR and RADAR for high-resolution distance measurement and ranging on the roads. My idea would be to use this capability and turn it inward. No amount of passive intervention or rewards/penalties would work to deter drivers bent on being distracted and lazy at the driver's seat. It isn't worth risking lives on the road due to traffic accidents caused by distracted drivers. Once this is accepted, autonomous car owners would be willing to let the car monitor their eye, hand and body movements to prevent any risks. I suggest that we integrate autonomous vehicles with interior RADAR systems that measure: 1. The hand and body movements of the driver. 2. How open is the driver's eye, averaged over a minute-cycle. 3. Heart rate/pulse 4. Metabolic rate All these need to be done without being too invasive, which is possible with current technology - for example, LED-based heart-rate and blood glucose measurement systems. If at any time the monitoring system detects that the driver is not alert, take the following steps: 1. Offer coffee/tea to wake up, from the cup holder seat. 2. Create visual stimuli to wake up the driver. 3. Create auditory stimulus (sounds) of increasing loudness if needed. 4. If all else fails, apply a gel that adsorbs into the skin to stimulate and chemically wake up the driver. The interior of the car has many seats and reflecting walls, so the interior RADAR system needs to be calibrated against fading, multi-path interference and other effects to reliably work in such a small space. This is a rather inexpensive system compared to LIDARs.  You might think this is a very invasive idea, but trust me, it is the only way - monitoring and active intervention. For example, talking to denizens of a city on the goodness of recycling goods and reducing plastic use is nice, but not too effective. On the contrary, putting a price on plastic bags at grocery stores has reduced their usage significantly. Such a penalty system is what is needed in tandem with technological monitoring.",5.166666666666667,0.021926450482675733

The timing is asynchronous, non-periodic and random, so that the driver cannot predict when s/he will be required to perform it - s/he cannot game the system. The action that needs to be performed is changed every few3 0 minutes/miles, so the driver needs to be alert to perform it correctly.

Penalties will be levied for missing the action, at different levels. I'll describe the penalty tiers below, but I want to stress that a self-driving car is already a very sophisticated technology, and we should focus on making the monitoring/policing system for the driver's alertness less intrusive - which entails a passive technological solution with active involvement from the driver rather than the other way round. Penalty tiers: 1. Flashing lights on the screen for the first couple of missed actions. 2. Beeps that get louder as more actions are missed. 3. Slowing down the car and moving it to the right lanes if all light and sound cues are ignored. No one wants to be stuck on the road for longer than they can, so slowing down should be a good deterrent against distractions. 4. Monetary penalties if all 3 previous cues are ignored. 5.

Focus of the game should be put on oddities in the world, which should keep the engagement level higher - i.e. counting silver Toyotas is not really engaging in comparison to looking for something more rare. Another option is counting odd licence plates (either individualized ones, or out of state) is another option. Or calculating easy math tasks like adding or subtracting mile-sign from speed limit sign to ensure driver is actually checking his surroundings.   Taken to another level, if self driving cars are interconnected enough, they could have displays on their back windows. These displays would provide some sort of engaging tasks (again, think easy brainteasers) which could be more easily verified as well as changed quickly in time to substitute reality (i.e. cars, signs, etc.) with content that can be easily replaced.

"A simpler solution is to have a camera installed on the dashboard in the front of the driver sending images of the driver's eyes to the car's computer. It also records how often the driver blinks his eyes. If the frequency of the driver's blinking is much lower than a set minimum (&gt;15 seconds between blinks?), the computer will sound an alarm, since it may suggest that the driver is not alert. An alert will also be sounded if the camera finds the eyes to be closed for more than 2 seconds, specially when this happens more that a few times over period of  one or two minutes.",4.805555555555555,0.05198752449100364
"Each self-driving car has a ""whack-a-mole""-style setup on the front console (what we today call the dashboard) - wherever the person who has to pay attention sits, and in a position where in order to see the setup, the person must be looking forward at the road.   Every set increment of time - for example, every 7 minutes - a ""mole"" pops out of one of the holes. Let's say there's 7 holes total. The ""driver"" has 10 seconds to whack the mole, to prove they are paying attention. If they do not whack it within 10 seconds, then the car gives a beep, and they are given another 10 seconds. If they still do not whack it, then the car gives a verbal warning and another 10 seconds. After this (30 seconds), if the person has not whacked the mole, the car pulls over to the side of the road and stops, as it assumes that the ""driver"" is no longer alert/paying attention.   This whack-a-mole idea can be made even more fun/even more gameified by the car manufacturers themselves. For example, Ford can let their consumers know that after 20 consecutive ""mole whacks"" under 5 seconds, the driver gets $1 off their next oil change, or car service, or similar.  Further, car manufacturers can partner with other brands to offer incentives. For example, Ford can partner with Starbucks, so that once the driver hits 5 red moles, they receive a $5 gift card. This gift card wouldn't be a physical card, or something they'd have to show on a mobile device - it's ""attached"" to the car, so that when the car goes through the Starbucks drive through, the $5 gift card is automatically detected.  A system like this could provide many corporate branding/marketing opportunities, make paying attention while ""driving"" incentivized and fun, and solve the original problem of keeping peoples' attention while they are in a self-driving car.

"When buying the car, the buyer agrees for the car manufacturer/dealer to initiate a full-body scan by the car while the individual poses in several alert positions and then takes the car on a final test drive. These body scans occur from the car's driver seat, the dashboard, and the top of the windshield, which take note of the driver's posture, angle of the head/chin/neck, distribution of weight on the seat, etc. Only the car manufacturer/dealer may delete these full-body scans. After these scans are completed, the car will know how the driver appears when alert and paying attention to the road. When the driver is driving anytime afterwards, the car periodically scans from the same areas - say, once every 2 minutes - and if the current posture is drastically different from the alert postures the individual and car dealer inputted, the car will cause the seat to vibrate at a moderate speed to catch the driver's attention. To stop the vibration and prove alertness, the driver will press a button located near the cupholder, which is nearby the driver and does not require much looking downwards and searching (taking attention away from the road). If the driver does not press the button in 30 seconds, the car will guide itself safely to the side of the road to park for 5 minutes, which is a penalty for failing to be alert.

These virtual elements could be any of the following !  1. Augment reality with games - Imagine playing a game while you are driving ! These games would make a person feel as if they are playing a game. All the elements of the reality will be present - for eg. other vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs/signals etc. but there will an additional gaming element to make the driving fun. Infact, this augmented grid will be much more difficult so that the person does not crash. Research shows that gamers have very good attention span while they are paying games. This will result in both fun and active user engagement.  2. Augment reality with beautiful scenes - Not everyone likes to play games, but everyone would love to drive through a scenic route. Imagine driving through the scenic Alps or the Pacific coast while you are on your way back from a busy day at work. You could also choose a VR with beautiful sunset / a starry night. Again, the elements of reality are present, they are just gift wrapped and presented to you in a better way so that you could enjoy your ride.  3. Augment reality so that your favorite celebrity is sitting right next to you in your car. They will chat with you nicely. Ask you to pay attention if you are not.

"To encourage driver safety in self-driving vehicles, specifically ensuring that drivers are paying attention to the road as much as possible even if they are not controlling the vehicle, cars could incorporate auditory and visual feedback. Specifically, strategically placed lights and speakers within the vehicle could confirm that a driver is paying attention (ex: via calm music and green light) or not (ex: via intermittent harsh sounds and red light). Research could be done to fine tune what types of sounds to play and what colors are light are best to use in order to minimize additional distractions caused by this system and ensure driver safety. Further, the in-car system could record statistics about how often the driver does and doesn't pay attention. This information could be displayed on a digital car dashboard and potentially be used towards gamifying the system. That is, drivers could connect with their friends and aim to have the best ratio of paying attention the road versus not. Finally, for drivers who do not pay attention often enough, they may be required to watch a safety reminder video before their next ride.

"Driving as we know it today is a constant evaluation of your surroundings. It includes little bit of math, little bit of physics, recognition of cognitive abilities of other drivers, reading road-signs, knowledge of what you can do (rules) as well as your car can do. However, driving mostly includes your own experiences with the whole package, this is the invaluable part of the whole process. With self-driving cars, driver switch seats with the car. Everything mentioned above is executed by the car and driver should be ready to become supporting and fail-safe system in the car, at least until your car gets enough experience on its own. What I propose is how make this fun and engaging and prevent yourself from dying as a byproduct.   Danger comes from the outside and driver's engagement need to be focused on the outside. Car would ask driver how he thinks some event taking place outside will turn out - sort of a betting on turnout of a particular action. Driver could compare car system's estimate (which is already taking place anyway) and if he turns out to be correct, this can be used further to improve car's system. Drivers I know also love to swear based on actions of other drivers. This could be also used as engagement enhancer. Also, local peculiarities could be used as an engagement tool, be it either weird traffic rules, interesting fact about something close to road etc. Another type of questions could be on road conditions - e.g. when driving down to forested valley in the morning, experience driver expects road to be wet due to natural humidity in forest. You can also place ""a bet"" on this and see if it is true.    Further, required engagement level would differ based on speed and/or location (city/countryside roads/highway) and gravity and probability of danger. Especially in exceptional conditions, both larger engagement as well as testing and comparing driver's experience with car's assumptions could prove beneficial.",5.25,0.023459704442429407

There is also a possibility to have a regular interval where the driver touches certain surfaces of the car to force them to look around. For example, the front dashboard to look out the windshield, the rear view mirror to check it, the side of the driver door to check blindspots, etc. This technology would be more advanced if there was a way to track eye motion as well as hand motion.

"Self driving vehicles are a convenience  in our society and depending on demand may become a necessity and the only option - if all are on board then we don't have human error involved, at least at the driving level.   What I foresee as the biggest issue, as does this group is the human involvement for the person who is operating the vehicle and how to keep them engaged to avoid accidents and overall, death.   If we look at what the media says is a huge cause of accidents, it is distracted driving. Not having to pay attention to your driving pushes for  less engaged drivers and more issues, even if they in the vehicle - the biggest culprit - Cell Phones  Solution - The Cell Phone is the key, literally, the key to your vehicle. You plug it in to engage the engine and after that it is inaccessible while the vehicle is on. Features of your phone are still accessible (reading texts, phone calls, music, updates) via an AI feature similar to an Alexa, but you won't be able to access it with your hands, nor will a passenger.   While not having access to your cell phone doesn't solve the problem of nodding off while driving and being distracted by a book, it takes away the biggest and growing issue. To address the rest of the distraction are a set of check -ins that really get back to the basics of driving. Remember in driving classes that check of the mirrors? With developing eye tracking technology an AI computer can check to make sure that you are indeed checking your 3 mirrors, the road ahead and your dash board warnings. This could also do some checks for impaired drivers (look at eye tracking technology and what is doing for concussion protocol - similar studies could be done on impaired drivers). You could play around with the idea of having constant contact with the steering wheel or brake, but mental engagement goes a lot further in my mind (No Pun Intended).   If the driver fails to meet the standards of the check-in, the car will pull off the road and stop itself and won't start for 5-7 minutes. With convenience being the biggest factor, this makes it really inconvenient to not be engaged with your vehicle.  The biggest drawbacks that are going to have to wait on technology are going to be the calibration of the eye tracking software, but based on reports, we are 7-10 years away from self driving vehicles being the norm.

"""Maps"" for self-driving cars.  When you're driving a car, you are able to use applications like Google Maps to show you where the nearest/cheapest gas station is located, but that information is only accessible on a smart phone or tablet. Wouldn't it be great to have that information visible without looking at a tablet or phone?  By creating an application like Google Maps specifically for self-driving cars, it will allow users to find the nearest gas station or closest Mexican restaurant just by looking out their window. This application connects with car systems, so you can enter what you are looking for and easily find it without taking your eyes ""off the wheel"" by using the windows to project images that relate to the outside environment. For example, passengers can enter ""gas station"" in the search bar and when they look out their windows, they see pin drops of all the nearest gas stations with their prices. Another example is if a passenger is looking for fast food restaurants,  a pin drop will show the nearest fast food chains. This will help passengers gauge proximity and help with their selections while ensuring that they are paying attention to their surroundings.  This is especially beneficial for long distance driving, especially on road trips down HWY 5 where passengers are not familiar with the surrounding area.

" One of the main goals to make sure that the person is able to keep their eyes on the road and monitor for any changes that may need intervention. Assuming that the car also has sensors for being close to another car or veering off the road, the idea would be to keep people engaged by playing an obnoxious alarm unless the person stays engaged. This could be done sequentially i.e every 15 minutes (or whatever preset time) and when the car senses that it may be veering off the road or driving too close to a car. The only way to inactivate the obnoxious alarm would be to answer basic questions such as what color is the sky? What animal makes a meow sound? Etc, easy questions that the person can answer.

"The key to make sure that drivers stay engaged when they are driving driverless cars is to give them an incentive to stay focused. One way to do this is to have a slot machine appear on the touchscreen every once in a while. The key here is to set the time span uncertain. For example, if drivers know that a slot machine will appear every 20 minutes, they will just not pay attention for those 20 minutes. However, if this time the slot machine appears after 5 minutes and next time it appears after 10 minutes, drivers will always be on alert and pay attention so that they don't miss another opportunity. Coffee and caffeine can help people stay alert too. So another component to this idea is to work that into the slot machine scenario. Whenever the slot machine appears, an alarm will beep to remind the driver to take a sip of coffee. After the sensor senses that the coffee has been taken out of the cupholder and placed back in, the slot machine will immediately appear again. This way, drivers have an incentive to drink coffee because of financial incentives.",3.5277777777777777,0.03429971702850177

"Drinking liquids of any kind while operating a vehicle exposes a drivers to an increased risk of crashing.  This effect is amplified when the user is operating a self-driving car, because of the assumption that the user's incentives to stay alert are significantly lower.  Drinking can be distracting both mentally and physically, and should be prevented.  My solution involves adding basic intelligence to drink holders to enforce distraction-free driving.  Although there are several classes of solutions to this issue, all involving different assumptions of risks associated with drinking and engineering budgets, I propose the solution that is in my opinion the most feasible for commercial use.  The solution involves the traditional design of the retractable drink holder (which is accessible and elegant, so that the driver doesn't prefer his lap or his hand as a holder), augmented with a simple capacitive sensor on the bottom that detects if a vessel containing liquid is in the holder, accompanied by an infrared sensor that detects if an object of any kind is in the holder.  Using information from these sensors and the self-driving system, the car will alert the driver if the driver is detected picking up his drink while the car is moving in self-driving mode, using the combination of sensors to differentiate between a full vessel and an empty vessel.  When this happens, the car's alert system will remind the driver to put down the drink.  This system can be made more or less strict: To make it more strict, it can easily be applied to all driving situations, self-driving or not, which is especially useful for places like Washington where drinking anything while operating a car is illegal.  To make it less strict, it can suppress alerts unless the self-driving system reports a high-risk driving environment.",3.9166666666666665,0.024318019154289876
"The goal is not to simply keep passengers awake, but to have them pay active attention to the road. Simply having the passenger try to pay passive attention to the road could be too boring, putting the passenger to sleep. Instead, active engagement with road landmarks could be helpful. To do that, the car manufacturing company could install signs on the road with trivia questions and, at some distance, signs with their answers. Between reading the question and reading the answer, the passenger has to be actively seeking the sign with the answer, thereby also paying attention to how the car is maneuvering the road. To add an incentive (if finding out the answers to trivia questions is not rewarding enough), the passenger could input the question and answer from the signs they just passed to a computer hooked up to the car (so that only people who own the car benefits from this system), for which they'd earn points.

A major problem with self driving cars is the drivers ability to be watch and be engaged with the road while not actually driving. Developing a translucent display (like an iPad home screen) over the windshield could fix this problem by bringing the focus of the driver's gaze to the road through the use of enticing iPad entertainment. The driver could touch in space and control the screen just like they would on a normal iPad.

It'll show the odds of a mistake happening if the passenger is not paying attention in a visually appealing/intuitive way. For example ""You wouldn't bet your safety on a roll of the dice. So why should you bet your safety on a self-driving car?"" Afterwards, the screen will go blank during the ride so as not to be a source of distraction. At intervals throughout the drive, an automated voice would remind the passenger to pay attention to the road. It would use information about the actual terrain the car is on to give specialized warnings about mistakes the car may make. For example, if the car were on a windy road, the voice could remind the passenger not to let the car pass another car on the road when a bend is coming up. The warnings/reminders would be more frequent in driving conditions in which the car is more likely to make a mistake.  The system will keep track of all the interferences the driver makes while the car is self-driving and use machine learning to give specialized feedback reports to the passenger. For example, if there are adjustments the driver didn't make that should have been made, it will tell the driver exactly what to do differently next time in a similar situation (considering these were not big mistakes that wrecked the car). The system can also be used to learn the driver's particular preferences and incorporate those into the self-driving patterns later on. (For example, going slower on windy roads.)

"This idea is based on the concept that the groups of people who will buy self-driving cars will want ease and comfort in their experience, and will want the self-driving feature on top of most of the other ""luxury"" features of a non-self-driving car.  To get these first users of this technology to stay awake and pay attention, I propose that we include a ""game""- like aspect to their experience to facilitate this.   For example, on a small screen on the dashboard, the car will query you for something that it can check, to see if you're paying attention. The car will have sensors that will survey and categorize things in front of it, not dissimilar to the technology behind its self-driving capabilities. It will log things such as different colors of cars, density of cars on the road, curvature of the road, first character of the car in front of you's license plate, etc. The car will then ask the user questions based on things happening on the road. For example the car could query the user ""Is there a red car within a 2 car radius?""   The user will have a lever or a button that they can press that they should press if they see a red car within a certain radius of the car they're in. Generally, these questions will be phrased in yes/no variants as to maximize the time the user is keeping their eyes on the road.  If answered correctly, the user will be able to experience a ""reward,"" or in this case, to make it mandatory, a restoration of the car's full capabilities.

Luxury features such as, a coffee dispenser, aux input, USB charging, voice recognition, seat heating, etc.  The questions would change so users would have to pay attention. If the user does not answer the questions within an appropriate amount of time, the car can assume that the user is asleep. If light flashes or sound attempts to wake up the user does not work, then the car will alert other cars behind it that its driver is sleeping, and it would safely pull over and stop moving.

As an example, if the car knows it's about to enter a 65mph zone as it enters a freeway, it will load a 6 into the first slot in the machine. Knowing this, the user will be required to keep an eye on the road in order to spot another 6.

The first thing is to offer a free coffee at Starbucks for every person once a week. Each driver will be getting a unique ID. Every time when they coffee, they will be earning certain points. Once these points accumulate every person will be eligible for either lunch or dinner at a restaurant based on the number of points.

"Have the driver's wheel give sensory information about what is happening on the road. For example, the wheel could have specific vibration patterns that are particular to predetermined road conditions. Think of how a videogame controller vibrates and adapt a similar concept to the driver's wheel. Other sensory cues could be sound cues that play from the wheel under certain conditions. One scenario could be if a car in front suddenly stops then the wheel plays a sound or vibrates in a particular way.   Furthermore, in order to engage the driver even more have it be a requirement for the driver to always have their hands on the wheel. This can be monitored using heart rate sensors that can give the car information about the driver's state of consciousness. Additionally, if the driver needs to drive the car themselves then the wheel can have an easy to access button or lever that the driver can engage to use manual driving mode rather than automated. This requirement, coupled with vibrating sensory cues, could prove useful in engaging drivers on the road when the car is automating the driving for them. ",4.833333333333333,0.03296902366978935

"The idea is to develop a system that obliges the driver to take a sip from a cup sitting in the cup holder. Every time the driver does this, he will earn bonuses for a game. The bonuses will be displayed on the windshield. Every 2minutes (which seems to be a good period of time to remind the driver of paying attention to the road), a beep tone will recall the driver to take a sip from his cup. The autonomous system can only be launched if there is a cup (even empty) in the cup holder. If the driver doesn't want to drink or has finished their drink, they can just fake the action of drinking. The system detects when the cup is lifted up, either using an optical sensor or using a piezoelectric material based sensor. If the driver doesn't accomplish the action within 20sec, a very loud beep tone will start to make sure the driver take part in this attention exercise. Once the driver lifted up the cup, they will earn 3bonuses for a mini-game on the app, linked to the car. The app will record and display statistics about your attention the road (how fast do you respond to the stimulus by lifting up your cup, success rate, etc...) but the ap will also take the shape of a game, where you have to collect badges or objects to go up in ranking. These bonuses will be displayed at three different places on the windshield in order to catch the driver's attention to these important spots (such as both sides of the road, or the middle of the field of vision of the driver). The bonuses will be chosen drawn by lot, and the drawing will be displayed at the windshield in a similar way as machine slots display the result of the game.

Any laid back posture that reflects lack of attention on the road can be monitored.   - the driver needs to be attentive and maybe we can measure his attentiveness through his grip on the car steering wheel. A certain amount of strength might be required to actually keep the self driving mode of the car on. As soon as the grip loosens the car will intimate the driver to take control  - another feature can be that the driving seat detects the posture of the driver.

"The problem of distraction in self-driving cars is one that we will have to face very soon. Instead of trying to get rid of all distractions all together I thought it interesting to try and control that distraction into several small moments.

It sort of stays in a cash within the car and you can cash in on your little break whenever you need to during a drive.

"A really good way to incentivize drivers in self-driving cars to keep their eyes on the road is to provide a monetary reward for good driving behaviors. These behaviors could be keeping their eyes on the road, or physically reacting or taking over the car in dangerous situations.

This could be in the form of a virtual slot machine on a small screen inside the car, where the driver gets to play for money, or perhaps the reward could be a voucher for free coffee. There could also be other reward mechanisms. The self-driving car could have internal and external sensors, so that if another vehicle or object gets too close to the self-driving car, and the driver physically takes the wheel or reacts in a way to prevent a crash, a monetary reward would be given. The steering wheel could also have sensors, and similar to the eye tracking concept, if the driver keeps their hands on the steering wheel for a certain amount of time without stopping, they could get a reward. This could even be combined with the eye tracker, so if there is constant eye movement and steering wheel usage for 10 minutes, a reward is given.

You don't know where you are, but everything is taken care of, like the clothes you wear, and the food that you eat. You travel far. You lost track of where you are. You could be in Africa, because there's a lion outside of your window, or it could be somewhere else, and the lion was transported. You have great adventures, and then finally, the group finds themselves in some exotic locale, like Mongolia, or Greenland, or Tokyo. There you experience authentic local foods and traditions. And near the end of the trip, a cult initiation begins. Things get scary and serious. You don't know what to do. Until things get too scary that someone flips out, and it is revealed that it's just all pretend. Then you take a plane back home.",4.75,0.020281847857870912

Evaluate flights and poll people to see what areas in the us and Europe, Asia, Ireland, England, etc are most popular with tourists. Be sure anyone who wants to take these trips is aware of costs, but also that if they manage to spend the least on their trip they will be reimbursed for their cost. Everyone should take the same I initial flight to the location. Money can be saved by spending less on food or accomadations.

"Finally, a new traveling experience taking place across hundreds of countries that appreciates our native sense of intrigue, and urge to explore: World by Rails. World by Rails is offered throughout a series of countries/continents: - West Europe: Germany, Italy, Austria, Spain, France, etc. - Africa - Eastern Europe - Asia: China, Japan, S. Korea, etc. - Oceania + Australia - N America: the US and Canada. Service starts with a trip to one known location, for example, the customer knows that they are first starting in Barcelona. However, this is where the mystery begins. Customers, from this point onwards, have no knowledge of their travel route (only general ideas from their county/continent package) until they receive their next ticket. They must remain in the origin city for at least 24 hrs for an attendance check by the trip guide (who knows the full schedule of the trip and help to lead customers through the destinations/schedule). The Trip Guide will meet participants at the train station 2 hrs before departure to hand out tickets to the next destination. This is the moment of discovery and adds to the joy, surprise, and anticipation. Generally, trips are to 3-4 cities depending on the length of travel to each destination (can definitely vary based on trip package, size of the county for example). Room Booking: Lodging is pre-booked by the service based on # of guests, children, etc. This will also confirm whether customers are OK with over-night train lodging. Train Rides: Arguably one of the most important aspects of the trip, purposely booking scenic routes to destinations (some short, some long). Some will have general seating, others will have overnight/comfort seating for longer trips to destinations. Dining included on some rides. ​This also encourages customers to bond with one other will commuting in the group.",4.875,0.021764860270317654
"This idea and project will be allowing our current railway and transportation systems to be fully powered by electricity. This will eliminate the need for fossil fuels within 15-20 years for our railroads and transportation, civilian and commercial. The new or current organization who pursues this initiative will establish contracts with government agencies and private contractors/corporations to maintain and financially support the ideas, functions, and management of the system. They will also cooperate and adhere to EPA policies and protocol. The implementation of the current subset of policies would involve phasing out the current systems and operations over time. Other indoctrinations would include allowing the grid to be powered by renewable energy sources. If not, then there will be new stations constructed. In other words, this idea will provide a framework and enhancement of current every system.

There are many train enthusiasts who love to travel. Incorporating their love of trains and creating a project for future generations to enjoy is an exciting endeavor. Throughout the United States and the world there are train tracks not being used anymore. Some are located in small towns and big cities. Travelers are invited to participate in building a structure that will hold nostalgic train memorabilia. There will be trained building professionals but creativeness and improvising to make the structure unique are welcomed. Days before individuals participate in this building activity we will get the travelers even more excited about trains. There will be many train adventures. One that will be exciting is putting on an overnight murder mystery party on the train. People can dress in old fashioned garb to really enjoy this adventure. Fancy meals served on trains in years past will be part of this experience. On another day travelers will enjoy the knowledge of train historians. If individuals want to see what the engineer does driving the train that can be an option too. Another day of train travels actors will be hired who can do improv and they will sing/talk/joke about trains. To put an environmental twist the area near the tracks where the structure will be built will be cleaned and made beautiful. The last few days of travel the structure will be built. It will be an exciting time for these train enthusiasts. Since there is a lot to building a safe structure the travelers will not be able to finish the building but photos will be sent to them after they get home. This will be a train adventure they will never forget.,4.6,0.02376913442707642

You can spot wildlife and fish underwater and it would be very quiet. It would use some sort of magnet system in a tunnel which would propel it to great speeds and also not rely on fuels that could damage the environment or the earth.

"To some people, the hardest part of traveling is getting to the destination. Most of the time when we take a plane it seems to go fast and it's no big deal. However when people are traveling by train, the ride can be bumpy, long, and tiring, The compartments can be small and there is just not much to do which can make traveling with a family a very long tiring experience. Why not turn your train ride into something like you would do on a cruise? People do not mind sailing for so many days because there is entertainment and fun. Why not do the same thing on a train? Adding on compartments and customizing them to make it fun for adults and kids could be just the thing that is needed to make passengers forget that they are even traveling. Turn it into their vacation before starting their vacation. You can customize carts in certain sections of the train for adults with jacuzzi's and entertainment and even bars. You can customize other carts for kids with ball pits, video games and television. Extra carts can be added on as a buffet area for families to re-join aftr having their fun. It can be bought as a package before the trip which will help pay for these extra services and as time goes on more and more people will want to do this and more can be added on.

"Bucket List Adventures - It is time to fill your bucket list and we are here to help A person or a couple comes in with their bucket list. An agent, very experienced in travel options talks with them about it, everyone getting excited. They organize things by priority, money and times. That is one of the positive business features, you have a customer coming back to you over and over again. Some items may be easy, like skydiving and it can be arranged locally. Some use more tradition travel plans, like a trip to Paris. Others may be unrealistic, like climb Mount Everest, but the agent could help the customer pare it down, like go to a one-week climbing school, or climb an easier mountain. The exact details of the entire plan are not written up immediately, Maybe plan 3 -4 things a year. The beauty is that you have an invisible ""contract"" to keep the travel plans going as you are partners in this idea. Maybe there can be surprise adventures when five Bucket List adventures are complete. An example would be a hot air balloon ride. I can imagine the plan branching off. What if a spouse wants a certain adventure, and the other doesn't. There is another plan. What if a group of people wants the same adventure. Now everybody is booked on a bicycle tour of Italy.

These buildings could be shops or a number of different things that would occupy the ground floor, with a second floor that would essentially act as the terminal for people to get on and off. The second floor could then be enclosed yet have a set of sliding doors much like subway trains do that would allow people to stay out of the weather while traveling between the different stops that are connected.

Any passenger who is able to save the day by stopping the robbery/capturing the robbers becomes the train hero and is treated to a VIP experience for the rest of the trip as well as numerous casinos comps when we get to our final destination. Be careful though. Or you might end up tied to the train tracks. To add insult to injury when you are finally freed you will be the train Hero's personal servant for the rest of the trip, and lose all your wealth.",4.7,0.024267841905814505

"Travel agencies can organize thematic tours in national parks where participants will live for several days or more in a state of isolation from the outside world, without means of distance communication and without the comfort of modern civilization. They will be trained to buy their own daily food and ensure the necessary living conditions. This experience can be linked with some medical recommendations for those with mental disorders that recommend quietness and relaxation in the middle of nature. This new experience would be an escape in nature, in which the participants will learn to defend and respect the nature and the planet that nourishes us all and who endures daily a human assault. It would be a lesson of respect and concern for the environment.",4.05,0.05337605126836238

"My idea is that of a vehicle - land, sea, or air - that is powered by the activity of its passengers; essentially a far more complex hamster wheel. There would be multiple 'classes' giving customers a choice of prices and activity level - for example, those on the cheapest fare are essentially in a combination gym/seating area, those in next tier are more seating than gym, and the last tier is seating only. There would be incentives and reward programs to encourage activity - points accrue faster or there are double point opportunities regularly for those in the two levels of activity-based fare. It would be easy to partner with certain destinations to promote ecotourism as a way to encourage travel in an eco-friendly way to certain destinations of natural beauty. It would also be a natural fit to link with eco-businesses and get exclusive deals on eco-friendly products - eg. be a pioneer in travel industry regarding reusable and non-single use only products, incorporate water bottle refill stations into the internal designs of the vehicle, etc.",4.425,0.042220033092074914
"I think the biggest hurdle for accessible air journey is fare. especially for overseas flights, even though it is getting cheaper compared to the last 2 decades, it is still not accessible for everyone. I believe the solution is personalized airfare, where the fee you are paying is determined by your credit score, your airplane etiquette (if you had an argument with a passenger it would lower your score) and more importantly income. if you have less income and flown few flights, your fare would be less and if you have high income and had many flights your fare will be higher. companies will earn more from the distribution as more people will flow. I think it is win win for companies and people with less income but people with higher income may be upset, howeveri they are the ones who can still afford it.",3.85,0.046373889576016826

Passengers will be able to ride on this train cruise for three days up through a couple weeks, if they want to. This train cruise will stop in many tourist locations so that the passengers are able to get off the train and explore the locations. Passengers can board the train at any tourist location, so someone who did not get on the train on day 1 can board on day 4 at another location, for example. This would give the passengers the opportunity to explore many different locations around the world while living and experiencing the life aboard a train.

"This is a two or three day trip on a passenger train across the Old West, combining a scenic trip with a history steeped in crime. This would be a fully immersive experience where employees are dressed in period clothing and passengers play the part of Old West ""characters"" such as cowboys, pioneers, prospectors, etc. On the first night, after everyone is in character and settled, there could be jewel heist. By the end of the trip, the person or group who discovers who did it can win a prize. There could also be reenactments of either battles or true crimes that were committed near the train tracks. It would be cool if as the train pulled into a station, a cowboy rode up on a horse and acted like he was robbing the train (just not too convincingly!). The ""cowboy"" could actually be a tour guide for a historical site and lead the passengers to a reenactment. This trip would be historical, scenic and fun. I think it would especially appeal to couples where one is more interested in history and reenactments while the other enjoys the scenery. I think it would be best to have a reenactment on one day at a historical site and a more relaxed trip to a scenic/historical site the next day.",4.825,0.03020610466650885

The train would have each car set up for a different group. Hopefully the musicians will form groups on each car and improv music together. One member from the featured band will be present in each car to improv with the musician riders. Everyone is welcome to board the train. Those without musical instruments will find an assortment of percussion instruments available so they may participate in the music if they wish. Or they can just sit back and enjoy the ride. The train will stop halfway through the ride and dinner will be served, probably local BBQ. While dinner is being enjoyed, guests aboard the train will get to experience a live concert on the tracks. The featured music group will have their equipment set up on the tracks. After dinner, riders must pick a new train car to create a new musical experience.

"My idea for a new tour excursion that can be offered by travel companies is something I call 'Pump-Car Rallies'. A pump car is usually made up of a platform with two axles that attached to railroad tracks. The car is moved using a 'pump' operated by a couple of passengers. In this case, different variations will be offered depending on the challenge a group wants. Some can be made using the classic pump feature, others could be made using pedals and gears like a bike, while others can be operated by a small motor for the ultimate luxury. The 'Pump-Car Rallies' will be offered all around the world, wherever abandoned train track routes can be found. Groups of people who signed up have the option to build their own Pump-Car or to have one provided for them. For groups that choose to build their own Pump-Car, they can choose how it is propelled, and are provided with the propulsion mechanism of their choosing as well as the wheels, axels, and a platform. It is then up to them to 'trick' it out in any way they choose. They can mount a couch, lazy-boys, or stools. They can build an enclosure or they can keep it mostly open to the elements. Lastly, they will decorate and paint it however they choose. The company offering the excursion will provide the necessary supplies. Once the 'Pump-Car' is built and tested, or when a group arrives and is ready to begin their journey in a provided 'Pump-Car', they will set out down the rails. There will be a variety of routes offered, some that are down hill in which you don't need to propel with anything but gravity, others will be mountain climbs that are more challenging, requiring more effort. There will also be fairly flat routes to choose from, or a route that combines several elements. The routes will be themed based on what the group is looking to experience. This can include routes that give you nature and country-side, routes that take you through cities, routes that highlight cultural aspects of the place, or routes that highlight historical sites of the place. Along the way there will be stops for breaks, as well as places to camp at overnight. For those looking for more luxury there will be cabins or other types of structures along the routes for people to stay in. Groups can do these adventures on their own, with just a few members of the travel agency to carry supplies and help as needed. Or, they can be full rallies with many different groups. If it is a full rally there will be rewards offered for best designed 'Pump-Car', most artistic 'Pump-Car', and other categories. This adds an element of competition while still remaining fun. Ultimately, the 'Pump-Car Rallies' will be a new way for people to experience different countries, getting to cover a lot of ground while exploring routes that not many other people get to see. If people really want to go all in, then they can combine many routes between countries, with the tour agency transporting their 'Pump-Car' between abandoned railroads. Hopefully this idea will spark a lot of interest and will provide something for everyone. Older folks can travel in a fully enclosed 'Pump-Car' with electric motor, while younger people can build their own and see how while their design performs.",5.275,0.013317952580768448
"Back in the early 1900’s trolley cars were popular in my community, in fact, the tracks are still present in some areas. They are narrower than train tracks and take up less room. It would be nice to revitalize this concept by initiating a similar platform that would be energized by batteries, electric, or a combination of both. The “cars” would be similar in appearance for nostalgia reasons, but energy efficient for environmental purposes. Supporting infrastructure will have researched, including the identification of existing tracks and their usability, as well as accessing the need for additional tracks to accommodate the distances and locations, which will be later identified. Traffic signage, fueling stations, additional related construction projects, envormental impacts, and other related matters will have to be coordinated, and in compliance with local laws and ordinances. Equally as important will be community acceptance as this new endeavor, which will initially cause additional traffic and delays. Also, the political impact is unknown as related to voters’ approval and the availability of building permits. Ultimately, this mode of transportation became antiquated shortly after the invention of the automobile. The struggles will be in educating and influencing the public. The intentions are not to replace the automobile, but rather provide a legitimate alternative source of conveyance that is fuel efficient, environmentally friendly, and fun.",4.6,0.028363801389869985
"My final idea is as follows. So it's essentially transplanting the concept that cruises use for trains. By that, I mean, that as well as being the means of travel, it also provides entertainment for passengers in various ways, during long intra-city train routes. The first part of this concept would involve the addition of a safe open-air car that exists for the purpose of tourism photography (not to mention be a safe place for people to smoke.) During the intra-city routes, the train would be slowed when passing exceptionally photogenic locations. The second part would be an interactive murder-mystery party, which would have several cars devoted to it. These murder-mysteries would be based off of Agatha Christie novels. As a train excursion concept, there would be several cars in the train devoted to ""club-style"" parties. There would be a car specifically designed for dancing, naturally a bar car, as well as more of a lounge space. The car closest to the rest of the train would also be soundproofed to avoid disrupting passengers. But, the sound system for all designated party cars would be interconnected. Now for the theme partied parts of my concept their finales would actually be located in the destination. Functionally, the end of the murder mystery would be at a lounge in the train station and there would be an afterparty located near the train. I believe this could be a more luxurious option for intra-city travel and actually entertain people who have to travel certain distances anyway.",4.375,0.025007816164017767

So for this idea, I would create an optional package for clients who would like to indulge in some authentic local meals, in reasonably safe areas.",4.05,0.05581455721859476

"My idea is called a ""Winter Themed Cruise Ship"" and it would be like a regular cruise ship but replacing a lot of parts with Christmas/winter decor. This cruise ship would offer tubing and fake snow for the kids to play in. It would also offer a heated pool and hot tubs. The rooms would be decorated with different Christmas movie decor so they are all unique. There would be unlimited Christmas movies to watch built in to all the tvs in each room. The buffets would consist of Thanksgiving/Christmas dishes along with other items. There would a hot chocolate and hot apple cider bar. The buffet would also feature an ice cream bar with all of the seasonal flavors you may miss getting during the year. A polar express train would go around the whole cruise ship where you could take a ride to meet the Grinch and Santa and Mrs. Clause for pictures. After getting pictures made there would be a petting zoo nearby where kids could pet real reindeer along with other animals that may rotate from trip to trip to give the animals a break. This cruise ship would run year round so you can experience winter/ Christmas any time you wish.",4.9,0.03494282789073061

"A train trip with multiple stops in different cities. 1) First, you need to find a train line that goes through a lot of different towns across the country, maybe from DC to the West Coast. There can be multiple different lines that go to different cities along the way. 2) Then you need to make stops in different towns that people would want to go to. Make sure that there is a train stop that allows people to easily access the town. The train cannot stop in the middle of an open field or in the middle of the woods to let people off. 2B) Once the stops are planned out, you would need to figure out a schedule of when trains will be in each city so that people can plan for the amount of time they want to stay in each city. A new train can leave the starting city every 6 hours. People can stay in each city for increments of 6 hours, up to 36 hours max. If they do not get back on the train within 36 hours, they will have to pay for another ticket. 3) The train tickets are coded with a bar code that tracks when you got off the train in the city. Therefore, the next train that comes along will know if you can get back on without repaying with a bar code scanner. 4) Passengers can skip cities they do not wish to stop at, though there will be stops to let others off and more people back on. Passengers cannot get on the train originally from cities in the middle, they must start at one end or the other. The only way people can get on the train in the middle of the route is if they stayed in the city for longer than 36 hours, but they may be turned down if the next train is close to capacity. 5) The train doesn't fill to capacity at the beginning of the trip to accommodate others who may have stayed in a city for different lengths of times. This will allow people to get on whatever train they wish in between instead of being told that the train is full and they will have to wait for the next one. 6) However, they can also choose to end their train trip early and just catch a different ride home, either driving, plain, or a non-stop train of their choice. 7) People's train rides may be shorter or longer depending on how long they plan to stay in each city along the path of the train ride. 8) There can be short train rides, or longer train rides, depending on the area traveled. For example, a train ride that has a non-stop length of 8 hours through only a couple states compared to a non-stop length of 24 hours across country. 9) Passengers can pay extra to transfer from one train-ride to another, but they must plan their trips ahead of time to avoid trains becoming over crowded. If too many people want to jump from train A to train B at the same time and location, the later passengers who request it will be told they have to wait a certain length of time before getting on train B.​",4.325,0.012979353291279125
"I'm proposing a trip by train with some friends. Sounds ordinary, right? Well here's the twist. It's a murder mystery trip! There is a murderer among the group! One of your friends is the murderer and it's up to everyone to find out who. The spontaneity comes from the fact that you can't plan how people will act and react. Yes, some of it is planned, but the majority will unravel naturally. The train is a great setting because you could also travel to other locations for clues and hints. Maybe plan it so you travel along and find evidence little by little. Similar to a loosely planned scavenger hunt. Start with some basic clues: the killer, the victim, the murder weapon. Maybe include some eye witness testimony. Have a few friends with some inside knowledge, but leave a lot up to chance. I think this would be a fun way to not only travel, but role play in a very creative manner. The themes and ideas are endless. The possibilities for adventure and crafty thinking are immense. I feel like the right group and mindset could really expand upon the initial framework of a simple game and really make a trip like this memorable and very unique.​",4.25,0.03165444689164591

The most fascinating event would be to travel to space and look back on Earth. However, this is not possible at the moment. So my idea of making a travel an extraordinary experience is to include a daring event such as bungee jumping, zip line adventure, skydiving, or climbing the tallest mountain in the area of the visit. These events would be memorable for entire life and would open up a new perspective or realization regarding ourselves relative to powers of nature.",3.5,0.052342392259021375

"People pay for a vacation that takes them from one city to another some far distance away. But rather than having a smooth cruise or train ride, what they do is take cargo trains. They jump trains at rail yards like homeless people or drifters do, and so have an adventure that they have to rough it through. The railyard and companies are all paid ahead of time, and there is security at each, plus the trains will have a way to contact for help in case of medical emergency, but people get to experience a rougher side of life. Not only do they come away more energized after having to use that pent up energy, but they would also gain understanding of how those people have to live.",3.85,0.05488212999484517

So its about a 2-3 hour tour. Start off by explaining the route or maybe have different routes based on riders ability. I want to make it only local shops and eateries that are local and support the local community and it just captures what it's like to live there and the spots that define the area. Go to artists shops or have street artists give a demo and explore the art of the area. Stop for great photo spots and let people get some great shots. Have people try some local food and make sure there is something for everyone.

Guest can choose among sleeping accommodations from either historical cabooses to modern cabooses, with decorum to replicate from actual train rooms accommodations.

"I propose the establishment of hiking trails that follow abandoned railroad beds. The beds should be located fairly near an already existing tourist site so that it can be considered a part of or an extension of an already existing vacation destination. The beds should also be long enough to allow for longer overnight camping hikes. Ideally, the shorter hikes could end at a picnic site, preferrably near a natural feature such as a waterfall, or perhaps near abandoned buildings allowing for further exploration. Historical markers along the shorter part could explore the history of both the tracks and the region. Longer beds that pass near cliffs/mountains could be used to appeal to rock climbers. Tracks that ran through now-abandoned towns would be ideal, and tracks through wilderness area would appeal to naturalist of all ages. Creating shorter, day trip hikes, should entice familiy vacationers.",4.55,0.04657464328326223
"Improvisational Cross-Country Train Ride/Flights/Bus Tour The goal of this plan is to offer someone who wants to travel the U.S. a way to create their trip as they go and have the same freedom of a roadtrip, while avoiding the hassles and costs of driving in their own vehicle, or in a rental car. It should be less costly than gasoline for the amount of miles and more fun for the adventurer. This plan is all about freedom. Often travel is about schedules and itineraries, fitting everything in at a given location while you are there. Sometimes disappointment that there wasn't enough time. What I want to allow is a set package of cities, within a set time frame where travel between them is whenever the traveler decides. We can travel into a city armed with so much information that we can find what we want to see almost immediately. Communication is easier than ever and a city can be experienced more quickly than in the past. Combine this with the speed and low costs of fast forms of travel it opens up the door to appeal to those who want to see a variety of places, cultures, landscapes on a single trip, rather than the traditional vacation consisting of several days discovering one or at most, a few, locations. This package could be created for many different places across the world but I will focus on an example for the US. I will stick with trains for my example but at any given point this could be interchanged for a bus ride, or whatever type of transportation is most efficient in cost and time. I think the logistics of trains and train travel make it the easiest way to imagine. I have not looked at travel times, or anything to figure out exact timing but lets imagine a tour consisting of these 9 cities, with an optional 10th. New York, Boston, Washington DC, Chicago(Milwaukee), Denver, Las Vegas, LA, San Francisco, Seattle. Now there could be options for how long of a trip you want to take, or your trip ""window"". One month, two months... The traveler has to travel in order of the tour but they can stay anywhere for as long or as little as they like. They could even omit places. Or they could pick a certain string of cities. For example they could choose DC, Chicago and Denver for a lesser rate. On average for a one month trip, it would be about 3 days at each city. I could go on and on about details. The full package would undoubtedly be a very extreme vacation package and perhaps not widely sought after but that is the very biggest version of the idea. The important part is that its a trip that offers a variety of locations, put together for a package price type value, that allows the traveller to change plans on a whim. If they see that there is a train going to their next destination with an open seat, they are free to hop on and keep moving. They just have to get to the end of the line within the window they paid for or end wherever they end up when the time is up. Now within this larger package, different city exploration packages could be offered. Or bus rides to neighboring cities, any kind of add-ons you can think of. This is my reason for adding Milwaukee in parantheses next to Chicago. Its a nice town only an hour away from Chicago. People may want to add on a rental car for a day to drive up, or a train or bus ride up to Milwaukee. If someone wants to see all of the cities but really likes the west they could make sure they end up in Denver for the longest period of time and explore the rockies for two weeks. One last time, multiple cities, free travel schedule. Affordable. Thats my idea",4.65,0.01183038514149988
"A package (2 for 1) vacation where everything is already planned out for you and the destinations are secret such that it will only tell you what to pack (ie clothing) but that is it. The trip includes two different destinations, each very different from each other. You are kept in the dark about the final destination (s) for each trip to build suspense and excitement. The all inclusive package includes airfare, car, hotel, restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It has novel and exciting activities planned for each day, and planned travel between stops (ie train, walking routes, buses). Everything is already planned for you, and thus takes away any stress of having to plan the entire vacation or figure out where you want to go in the first place. Each country is different from each other, such that the traveler gets to experience differences in climate/temperature (ie cold versus warm countries), differences in cuisine, culture, lifestyle and activities (ie sunbathing, snorkeling and swimming versus snowboarding, skiing or hiking). That way travelers don't have to miss out on just one option for a country; they can hit many different activities and places in one single vacation and not have to wait until next year for another trip. Ergo, one fabulous trip, two different vacation destinations, and twice the fun! If traveling alone, and feeling adventurous, the traveler has the option to pair with someone from another country on their trip and make a new travel friend. They can travel with this person and meet up at the beginning of the adventure. They will travel to the two different countries with this other person and make many new memories.

"Trains are an interesting form of travel, akin to landbound cruise ships, a sort of novelty means of locomotion in an age of planes and cars. I think it's important to consider that travelers interested in luxury train travel in the modern age pursue the novelty of something not unlike a mobile hotel suite. The isolation of trains from their surrounding environment can be an interesting theme, alone on a train with a group of strangers, it might seem you've entered a different world, with entirely different possibilities. Some might even be sinister. I think the rising popularity of scripted, but interactive experiences, things like ARGs and escape rooms, can be combined with luxury travel to create a unique travel experience for people seeking novelty and adventure. I propose a murder mystery taking place on a train. A group of strangers board a train together and soon after departure find things amiss, culminating into an impromptu investigation when a fellow ""passenger"" is murdered. Along with the customers, several staff members can be placed in the boarding group to enable an immersive experience complete with murderous conspiracies, kidnapping, and deceptive motives.

Listen to and watch your Native American guides as they tell tales around the campfire. Hear them talk of legends, myths and ghosts that inhabit the Nation. After all of this, head over to the Cherokee Nation for some much needed pampering and a night or two of gambling in the casinos.
